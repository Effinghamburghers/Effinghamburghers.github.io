      <description>&lt;p&gt;We thought it was going to be a quiet Sunday, one week after my arrest for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/xlv/466/466-31.htm&#34;&gt;barking dogs&lt;/a&gt;, but inept and corrupt Effingham officials had their eye on me via my neighbor, one of their own, a member of the Effingham ZBA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the latest salvo in an attempt to &lt;a href=&#34;https://effinghamburghers.github.io/2020/corrupt-officials-take-a-new-tack/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;shut down&amp;rdquo; my farming operation&lt;/a&gt; because they don&#39;t like my barking dogs but in the Granite State, livestock guardian dogs &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/xlv/466/466-31.htm&#34;&gt;are allowed to bark while guarding livestock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One week had passed since I was &lt;a href=&#34;https://granitegrok.com/blog/2020/02/corruption-in-carroll-county-new-hampshire&#34;&gt;arrested for barking dogs&lt;/a&gt; after a coyote deer kill on our property that kept the dogs busy overnight for four days. They did keep the coyotes away from the horse paddock and chickens, and the ZBA neighbor called the police. Over and over and over again. I spoke to our Fish and Game CO, and he assured me it was just coyotes, and he didn&#39;t have to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coyotes kept coming back, odd behavior because I&#39;m pretty sure the dogs maimed or killed at least one, which usually repels the whole pack. Friday night we had a pasture bonfire, and it was quieter, but Saturday night it was all howls and barking again. My older dog retreated to quietly guard the chickens, very odd. Whatever the predator was, she was outgunned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, our latest predator pressure had not been from regular coyotes, it&#39;s been from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coywolf&#34;&gt;CoyWolf&lt;/a&gt;, who are wolves in everything but name, although New Hampshire &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unionleader.com/news/animals/experts-howl-at-coywolf-headlines-limited-nh-hunting-season-called-for/article_99696d5b-92eb-5188-90ab-a9ee8e714a56.html&#34;&gt;classifies them as coyote&lt;/a&gt; for hunting purposes. I haven&#39;t seen them, but neighbors were posting that they have been spotted hunting deer on Champion Hill Road, our road.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coyotes of unusual size concern me. So we called our hunter friends to help, and kindled a small fire. We noticed Carroll County Sheriff deputies doing slow drivebys of our farm, and wondered what mischief was afoot. Our friends arrived for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wildlife.state.nh.us/hunting/small-game-season.html&#34;&gt;coyote hunting&lt;/a&gt; and sighted in their hunting rifles as we discussed our options, then they went to get some coffee and donuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes after they left two NH Fish and Game Conservation Officers pulled up. I was elated, perhaps they could help move the creatures on without us having to take any down. I welcomed them onto the land and brought them to the area were the deer carcass lay. They politely listened to my narrative and agreed that the killers were indeed coyotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they weren&#39;t there for the coyotes, they were at my farm at the request of the Carroll County Sheriff to investigate the rifle report. The same politically connected neighbor behind all of this malarky, the one who invites LEO who help him inside for coffee after they arrest me; the one who keeps tabs on my coming and going and diligently reports my whereabouts to the Effingham Chief of Police, among others, called the police, who called the Sheriff who called Fish and Game. The COs offered that this specific neighbor was the one who instigated the visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your tax dollars at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COs agreed that we were outside the 300 foot buffer, hunting in the proper safe direction, had the proper equipment for the type of predator hunting we anticipated, and we were within our legal rights to sight the hunting rifles. The kids returned with their coffee, pleasantries were exchanged, the the COs told us the department could possibly take action if our efforts failed. We thanked them and said goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a half an hour later, the Chairman of the Effingham Board of Selectman pulled into his ZBA buddy&#39;s driveway across the street to film us. I asked him if he was here in his official capacity. He turned his back to me. We&#39;ll find out on Tuesday evening if he considers his taping an &amp;ldquo;official act&amp;rdquo; or he personally dislikes us.&lt;/p&gt;
