      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chief Timothy Butts comes to Board of Selectmen on December 6, 2016 with a new idea on how to get rid of barking dogs. Chief admits that NH AG and County Attorney has verified that they can&#39;t charge me for barking because my dogs are bona fide LGD under the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They scheme to find a way to get rid of the dogs by suggesting that perhaps there is a cruelty to animals angle they can pursue criminally, and contacted the NH State Veterinarian and SPCA about an abuse charges and animal welfare, and how they are looking for a charge that will stick in District Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Henry Spencer alludes to illicit non-public meetings to discuss my dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also discuss helping neighbors pursue civil action against me.&lt;/p&gt;
